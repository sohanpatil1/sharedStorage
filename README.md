# sharedStorage

sharedStorage is an MQTT based platform that allows users to send files or data to another user without altering the firewall restrictions. This is a POC built with the aim of being able to backup your files onto your friend's machine. Since I know many people who do have available space on their machines I would like to backup my photos on their machine in a separate directory with dual encryption. This project was used as a POC to prove this could be done. I was able to make it work.
